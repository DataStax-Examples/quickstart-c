# DataStax C/C++ Driver for Apache Cassandra Quickstart
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beccam/quickstart-c.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beccam/quickstart-c)

A basic demo CRUD application using the DataStax C/C++ Driver for Apache Cassandra. 
The intent is to help users get up and running quickly with the driver. 
If you are having trouble, the complete code solution for `quickstart.c` can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/beccam/bcb2fdb81db931abb0d175ba0356c1fc).

## Prerequisites
  * A running instance of [Apache CassandraÂ®](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/) 1.2+
  * [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/download) v2.6.4+
  * [libuv](http://libuv.org/) 1.x
  * [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) v1.0.x or v1.1.x

## Create the keyspace and table
The `users.cql` file provides the schema used for this project:

```sql
CREATE KEYSPACE demo
    WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1'};

CREATE TABLE demo.users (
    lastname text PRIMARY KEY,
    age int,
    city text,
    email text,
    firstname text);
```
## Getting the Driver
You can obtain binary versions of the driver, available for various operating systems and architectures, from our [DataStax download server](https://downloads.datastax.com/cpp-driver/).The driver source code is available via [GitHub](https://github.com/datastax/cpp-driver).The C/C++ driver will build on most standard Unix-like and Microsoft Windows platforms. Packages are available for the following platforms:

* [CentOS 6](https://downloads.datastax.com/cpp-driver/centos/6/cassandra/)
* [CentOS 7](https://downloads.datastax.com/cpp-driver/centos/7/cassandra/)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](https://downloads.datastax.com/cpp-driver//ubuntu/14.04/cassandra)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](https://downloads.datastax.com/cpp-driver//ubuntu/16.04/cassandra)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://downloads.datastax.com/cpp-driver//ubuntu/18.04/cassandra)
* [Windows](https://downloads.datastax.com/cpp-driver//windows/cassandra)

If you are on MacOS, once you have the source code and nescesaary dependencies, you can build the driver with CMake:
```bash
mkdir build
pushd build
cmake ..
make
make install
popd
```
For more help with getting dependencies and building the driver from source code on different operating systems, check out the documentation on [building the driver]https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/cpp-driver/latest/topics/building/). 

Once you have completed filling in the code blocks (with the driver installed on Linux/MacOS) you also have the option of generating the quickstart executable with CMake, and the CMake configuration file provided. Follow these steps:
* Clone quickstart-c repository
* `cd quickstart-c`
* `mkdir build`
* `cd build`
* `cmake ..`
* `make`

## Connect to your cluster

All of our code is contained in the `quickstart.c` file. 
A new  `CassCluster` object will need to be created and configured to connect a session to our Cassandra instance. The minimal configuration needed to connect is a list of hosts. If you are not using `localhost` for your instance, provide the ip address of of your node in the main() function.
```c
// TO DO: Fill in your own host 
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  CassCluster* cluster = NULL;
  CassSession* session = cass_session_new();
  char* hosts = "127.0.0.1";
  char* keyspace = "demo";
```

## CRUD Operations
Fill the code in the functions that will add a user, get a user, update a user and delete a user from the table with the driver.

### INSERT a user
```javascript
CassError insert_user(CassSession* session, const Users* users) {
  CassError rc = CASS_OK;
  CassStatement* statement = NULL;
  CassFuture* future = NULL;
  
  // TO DO: execute a simple statement that inserts one user into the table
  const char* query =
      "INSERT INTO users (lastname, age, city, email, firstname) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";

  statement = cass_statement_new(query, 5);

  cass_statement_bind_string(statement, 0, users->lastname);
  cass_statement_bind_int32(statement, 1, users->age);
  cass_statement_bind_string(statement, 2, users->city);
  cass_statement_bind_string(statement, 3, users->email);
  cass_statement_bind_string(statement, 4, users->firstname);

  future = cass_session_execute(session, statement);
  cass_future_wait(future);

  rc = cass_future_error_code(future);
  if (rc != CASS_OK) {
    print_error(future);
  }

  cass_future_free(future);
  cass_statement_free(statement);

  return rc;
}
```
### SELECT a user
```c
CassError select_user(CassSession* session, const char* lastname) {
  CassError rc = CASS_OK;
  CassStatement* statement = NULL;
  CassFuture* future = NULL;
  
  // TO DO: execute a simple statement that retrieves one user from the table
  const char* query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE lastname=?";

  statement = cass_statement_new(query, 1);

  cass_statement_bind_string(statement, 0, lastname);

  future = cass_session_execute(session, statement);
  cass_future_wait(future);

  rc = cass_future_error_code(future);
  if (rc != CASS_OK) {
    print_error(future);
  } else {
    const CassResult* result = cass_future_get_result(future);
    const CassRow* row = cass_result_first_row(result);

    if (row) {
      const char *firstname = NULL;
      size_t firstname_length = 0;
      cass_int32_t age = 0;

      //TO DO: print firstname and age of user
      cass_value_get_string(cass_row_get_column_by_name(row, "firstname"), &firstname,
                            &firstname_length);
      cass_value_get_int32(cass_row_get_column_by_name(row, "age"), &age);

      printf("firstname: '%.*s' age: %d\n", (int)firstname_length, firstname, age);
    }

    cass_result_free(result);
  }

  cass_statement_free(statement);
  cass_future_free(future);

  return rc;
}
```

### UPDATE a user's age
```c
CassError update_user_age(CassSession* session, const char* lastname, cass_int32_t age) {
  CassError rc = CASS_OK;
  CassStatement* statement = NULL;
  CassFuture* future = NULL;
  
  // TO DO: execute a simple statement that updates the age of one user
  const char* query = "UPDATE users SET age =? WHERE lastname =?";

  statement = cass_statement_new(query, 2);

  cass_statement_bind_int32(statement, 0, age);
  cass_statement_bind_string(statement, 1, lastname);

  future = cass_session_execute(session, statement);
  cass_future_wait(future);

  rc = cass_future_error_code(future);
  if (rc != CASS_OK) {
    print_error(future);
  }

  cass_future_free(future);
  cass_statement_free(statement);

  return rc;
}

```   

### DELETE a user
```c
CassError delete_user(CassSession* session, const char* lastname) {
  CassError rc = CASS_OK;
  CassStatement* statement = NULL;
  CassFuture* future = NULL;
  const char* query = "DELETE FROM users WHERE lastname=?";

  statement = cass_statement_new(query, 1);

  cass_statement_bind_string(statement, 0, lastname);

  future = cass_session_execute(session, statement);
  cass_future_wait(future);

  rc = cass_future_error_code(future);
  if (rc != CASS_OK) {
    print_error(future);
  }

  cass_future_free(future);
  cass_statement_free(statement);

  return rc;
}
```
